Before graphical user interfaces (GUIs) became commonplace, computers primarily used command-line interfaces (CLI) or text-based interfaces for interaction.

## 1. How To Create Floder By Terminal:

```Bash
mkdir Code
```
- ***mkdir***: It is an abbreviation for _Make Directory_. And We should use it in beginning to create folder.
- ***Code***: The name of the folder we will create.

## 2. How to Create File By Terminal:
```Bash
touch index.html
```
- ***touch***: When we want to create file we must write `touch` in begginning.
- ***index***: The name of file we will create.
- ***.html***: The type of file we will create.

>**Tip**: You can create more than one file in the same command line by adding space between each file name.
